**The Branches feature is currently in private beta. Some features may not work as expected. Please bear
with us while we polish all necessities. Any feedback is welcome at [https://ideas.keboola.com](https://ideas.keboola.com).**

**To request to be a beta tester for this feature, please ask via the [support button](/management/support/) in your project.**

The Development branches feature allows you to modify [component configurations](/components/) 
without interfering with the running configurations or entire [orchestrated pipelines](/orchestrator/).
Typically, you would use branches when making bigger changes to a project or when you need to perform the changes safely.

The Branches tutorial is divided in the following parts that demonstrate different aspects of using branches.

* Part 1 -- Working with tables
    * [Preparing configurations](/tutorial/branches/prepare-tables/)
    * [Working in Branch](/tutorial/branches/tables-in-branch)
* Part 2 -- Working with files 
    * [Preparing configurations](/tutorial/branches/prepare-files/)
    * [Working in Branch](/tutorial/branches/files-in-branch)
* [Part 3 -- Merging branches](/tutorial/branches/project-diff/)
