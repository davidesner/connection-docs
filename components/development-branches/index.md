The feature Development/Production Mode enables you to develop code above your production data without affecting
or endangering the data in any way. It works as a version system where you create a new branch, make changes
in it, and run your configurations as needed. Output data is stored separately and does not overwrite your
production data.

In this tutorial, we will show you how Development/Production Mode works, what the process of developing in
a branch looks like, and what you need to do before you can start.

## Private Beta Warning
Development/Production Mode is currently in private beta. Some features may not work as expected. Please bear
with us while we polish all necessities. Any feedback is welcome at [https://ideas.keboola.com](https://ideas.keboola.com).

## Before You Start
To request to be a beta tester for this feature, please ask via the support button in your project.

In the next steps, we will create and configure various components to demonstrate the different aspects of branches.

* [Working with files](/components/development-branches/files/)
* [Merging branches](/components/development-branches/merge-to-production/)
